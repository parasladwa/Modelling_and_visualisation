# Modelling and Visualisation Projects

Welcome to a collection of simulation projects developed as part of my university course in **Modelling and Visualisation**. Each project focuses on simulating different physical systems or phenomena using computational methods in Python.

This repository showcases my ability to:

- Model real-world systems using numerical techniques
- Implement simulations from first principles
- Visualize and analyze results clearly
- Write clean, documented Python code

### üìò `exam` ‚Äì *Cahn-Hilliard Equation with Advection* (Exam Project, Produced Simulation from Scratch in 3 Hours)

This project extends the **Cahn-Hilliard phase separation model** by incorporating **advection**, simulating the effects of a velocity field on phase dynamics. Developed as part of a final exam, it demonstrates advanced numerical simulation skills and scientific visualization.

#### Features
- Solves the **Cahn-Hilliard equation** using central finite differences and `convolve2d` from `scipy`
- Implements **advection** with a sinusoidal velocity field
- Produces **animated 2D visualizations** of phase evolution
- Computes **variance at steady state** for different initial conditions
- Outputs results to `.txt` for further analysis

#### Simulation Parts
- **Part A**: Baseline Cahn-Hilliard simulation with animation
- **Part B**: Visual inspection and discussion (see included figures and `README.txt`)
- **Part C**: Plot of steady-state variance vs. initial œÜ‚ÇÄ
- **Part D**: Advection-enabled simulation to study flow impact
